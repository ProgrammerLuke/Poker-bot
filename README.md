This is a small Poker Bot project I decide to do. It is open to anyone to build thier own bots off of, and modify the game code as wanted. I know the code is badly written, and I will change it as I see necessary.
If you want to optimise it yourself, feel free.

Testing is just the latest commit, and main is the major version with (hopefully) fewer bugs.
